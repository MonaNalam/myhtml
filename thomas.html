        From July 2004 through June 2008, I was the director of the <a href="d">Dartmouth Institute for Writing and
            Rhetoric.</a><br>
        I occasionally taught a graduate Computer Science course on how to write papers and how to give talks. I publish

    <h2>Introduction to Algorithms</h2>
    <p>Yes, I am coauthor of Introduction to Algorithms, along with <a href="x">Charles Leiserson</a>, <a href="x">Ron
            Rivest</a>, and <a href="x">Cliff Stein</a>. For MIT Press's 50th anniversary, I wrote a post on their blog
        about <a href="x">the secret to writing a best-selling textbook.</a>
    </p>
    <p>Here are answers to a few frequently asked questions about <i>Introduction</i> to Algorithms: </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>
            <i>Will there be a fourth edition? If so, when will it be available?</i>
        </dt>
        <dd>The fourth edition was released on 5 April 2022. The <a href="s">MIT Press site for the book</a> has links to
            sites that sell it.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><i>Where can I find a list of errata?</i></dt>
        <dd>For the fourth edition, we maintain an <a href="s">errata page</a> that allows you to list errors by date, by
            page, or by severity.
            For the second and third editions, we maintained an <a href="s">errata page</a> that allows you to list
            errors by date, by page, by severity, or by discoverer. There is even an incremental update feature,
            allowing you to list only the errors posted since the last date that you asked about. We stopped
            logging errors for the third edition in January 2019 so that we could focus on preparing the fourth edition.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><i>How do I report errors?</i></dt>
        <dd>First, please visit the <a href="s">errata page</a> to verify that the error has not been reported already.
            Once you have determined that you have found an unreported error, send email to email to <a
                href="s">clrs-bugs@mit.edu</a>. We will respond as quickly as possible, often within a day.<br><br>
            Please use the <a href="s">clrs-bugs@mit.edu</a> address only to report errors. If you have a suggestion or a
            question, please contact me directly at <a href="s">thc@cs.dartmouth.edu</a>.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><i>Do you correct errors?</i></dt>
        <dd>Yes. Each time a new printing is produced, it contains corrections to all errors that have been reported by
            that time. The <a href="m">errata page</a> indicates in which printing each error was corrected.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><i>What is the difference between an edition and a printing?
            </i></dt>
        <dd>Each edition is a major revision of the book. The first edition of Introduction to Algorithms was published
            in 1990, the second edition came out in 2001, the third edition appeared in 2009, and the fourth edition is
            from 2022. A printing for a given edition occurs when the publisher needs to manufacture more copies. As the
            answer to the previous question indicates, we have been correcting errors in each printing of the second and
            third editions. We perturb the pagination as little as possible when correcting errors for a new printing.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><i>Can I get solutions to exercises and problems?
            </i></dt>
        <dd>As of the third edition, we are making available solutions for a select set of exercises and problems. They
            are posted at the MIT Press website.<br><br>
            We have also produced an Instructor's Manual, which is available only to instructors who have adopted the
            book for course use. The manual has lecture notes and solutions to additional exercises and problems, but by
            no means all of them. (I estimate that writing up solutions to all exercises and problems would take
            somewhere between 2000 and 3000 pages.) You'll need to contact the MIT Press for passwords to access the
            manual site and the files. (Contact information is at the MIT Press website.) You cannot get the passwords
            from me or from any of my coauthors.
            <br><br>

            <b>I will not respond to requests for the manual or for solutions.</b>
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><i>How can I typeset pseudocode to make it look like the pseudocode in the book?
            </i></dt>
        <dd>I created three packages for LaTeX2e. The clrscode package gives you pseudocode in the style of the second
            edition, the clrscode3e package gives you pseudocode in the style of the third edition, and the clrscode4e
            package gives you pseudocode in the style of the fourth edition.
            <br><br>You can download the <small>clrscode4e</small> package <a href="d">here</a> and its documentation <a
                href="d">here</a>.<br>
            <br>
            You can download either <small>clrscode</small> or <small>clrscode3e</small> and its documentation by
            clicking <a href="ss">here</a>. The clrscode package is also on the <a href="w">CTAN website</a>.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><i>Can you send me a free copy of the book? Can you send me an electronic copy of the book? Can you help me
                with this algorithms problem I have?
            </i></dt>
        <dd>No, no, and sorry, but no. You can purchase an electronic copy of the book, however: Amazon.com now sells a
            version of Introduction to Algorithms for Kindle.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><i>I see that there are two versions of the second edition, one published by the MIT Press and one published
                by McGraw-Hill. How do the two versions differ?
            </i></dt>
        <dd>Other than minor differences in the covers, the book content in the two versions is identical. McGraw-Hill
            also includes a CD (see the next question).
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><i>Are the algorithms in the book implemented in a real programming language, rather than just pseudocode?
            </i></dt>
        <dd>In the second edition, McGraw-Hill included with the book a CD containing Java implementations of all the
            algorithms in Parts I-VI. The CD also has Javadoc-generated web pages that document all the classes. We did
            not update the Java implementations for the third <br>
            For the fourth edition, we have made available on the MIT Press website <a href="s">implementations in
                Python</a> by Linda Xiao and me.</dd>

    <h2>Algorithms Unlocked</h2>
    <p>Algorithms Unlocked is a gentler, less technical, entry into algorithms than <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>.
        It contains some mathematics, but not nearly as deep as in <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>. The Amazon site
        for the book is <a href="k">here</a>, and the MIT Press site is <a href="s">here</a>.<br>
        I maintain an <a href="x">errata page</a> for Algorithms Unlocked. If you find an error in the book and it's not
        already in the <a href="x">errata page</a>, send email to <a href="x">algorithms-unlocked@mit.edu</a>. (The email
        address in the preface of the book is incorrect—the first known error in the book.)<br>

        Algorithms Unlocked is the <a href="f">10,000th book title published by MIT Press</a>.</p>

    <h2>Miscellaneous Personal Stuff</h2>
    <p>Follow me on<br>
        Twitter: <Twitter>Follow @thcormen</Twitter><br>
        <a href="f">Quora:</a> I'm a "Top Writer" 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. You can listen to the Quoracast (a podcast)
        <a href="f">in which I was interviewed.</a>
    </p>
    <p>You can also read about me on <a href="f">Wikipedia.</a> (Note: I did not create this entry, nor have I edited
        it.) I had been listed among "Noted residents, past and present" in the <a href="f">Wikipedia page on Oceanside,
            NY,</a> but someone removed me from the Oceanside page with the notation "Removed notable people who barely
        lived there or people who are not notable." Since I lived in Oceanside for the first 18 years of my life, I can
        only conclude that I am not notable.</p>

    <p>My wife, Nicole, and I took a Barbecue tour of the South in August 1998.</p>

    <p>In July 2010, I rollerbladed the <a href="a">Trail of the Coeur D'Alenes,</a> a 71.4-mile-long paved rail trail in
        the Idaho panhandle. Accompanied by my friend, Paul Daro, who also bladed, and Nicole, who biked, we went 42
        miles the first day and the balance the second day. Here is a <a href="n">photo</a> of the three of us at the
        start of the first day, at the western trailhead in Plummer, Idaho, (on the Coeur D'Alene reservation) and here
        is a <a href="a">photo</a> of Paul and me at the start of the second day, at the eastern trailhead in Mullan,
        Idaho. We met <a href="a">this fellow</a> on the trail during the first day. <a href="a">This page</a> has some
        rough videos that Paul took.</p>

    <p>I was the Ice Man for the <a href="a">Maryland State Barbecue Championship</a> in 2003, 2004, and 2005. Here's a
        <a href="a">photo</a> from the 2005 contest of me with a quad-runner full of 40-pound bags of ice. The photo was
        taken by the <a href="a">Dizzy Pigs,</a> the 2005 and 2006 Grand Champions.
        Even with the megaphone, I was pretty hoarse by the end of the second day. The Dizzy Pigs, and all the other
        contestants, can explain why.</p>

    <p>I was <a href="ds">Kansas City Barbeque Society</a> Certified Barbeque Judge number 62145. (I have purposely let my
        KCBS membership lapse.) My first contest as a certified judge was the 2011 Maryland State Championship in Bel
        Air.
        Here is a photo of me just starting to judge the first item, chicken. And <a href="s">here</a> is a photo after
        judging five entries each of chicken, pork ribs, pork, and beef brisket. (Photos courtesy of Craig Ward, a.k.a.
        "Mr. Time To Go," a.k.a. "Large And In Charge," the contest organizer.)</p>

    <p>September 1997, Nicole and I finished hiking all 48 of the 4000-foot peaks in the <a href="s">White Mountains</a>
        of New Hampshire.</p>

    <p>Have you ever noticed <a href="s">something odd about bank deposit slips?</a></p>

    <p>When is a <a href="s">door not a door</a>?</p>
